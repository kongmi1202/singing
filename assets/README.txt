Place assets under this folder.

Expected paths (can be customized in index.html/script.js):
- assets/midi/twinkle.mid    (baseline MIDI for demo)
- assets/audio/sample.wav    (optional sample audio for demo)

If assets are missing, the app will use a tiny synthesized demo audio
and a fallback demo melody.
